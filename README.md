3.Attach the components to motherboard : The motherboard has to be prepared before its installation. To prepare the motherboard,you first need to install the CPU, then the Heat Sink on the CPU and CPU fan.A CPU socket uses a series of pins to connect a CPU’s processor to the Pc’s motherboard. If a CPU is connected via a CPU socket.
